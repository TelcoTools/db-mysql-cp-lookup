# db-mysql-cp-lookup
Scripts to setup a MySQL/MariaDB database and load the Ofcom Numbering Data into it.

The original service, getCP, was all MariaDB backed, so I'm sharing the scripts that I used to load that data every week so that you can maintain your own database for this should you feel the desire.
